          <p>Having a project to work on is something I really need for myself. Upgrading my meatsuit is one of them. As silly as it sounds, I view the body as a meatsuit and think of it as a biological 
            machine that I can upgrade through physical exercise. Improving my grip strength and getting stronger with squats have been a priority. 
            Improving the meatsuit does not just mean physical strength either, I am also working on the mind and soul, which feels like a losing battle to be honest. I think one of the things I am lacking is a 
            project that I am really passionate about. Something I can work on over time and see growth, or development. Making a nice front-end website project is one of my ideas but my main idea that I would like to devote 
            a considerable amount more energy into would be a 2D top down video game. The idea is to make something in unity, like a diablo 2 / path of exile hack and slash style looter. It would be a single player game and have a
            story to complete with endgame playablity. I would like to document the progress in an HTML/CSS format to snapshot the development life and progress in web development at the same time.
            These sub-goals or side-quests are imperative and will bind together to form the results in completing the main-quest of upgrading my meatsuit.
