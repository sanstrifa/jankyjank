      It can be pretty easy to get carried away with negative thinking. It seems to feed into itself exponentially. The importance of staying focused is imperative. I have a limited amount of
      time to put into obtaining a position in life that would be desirable and more synergistic with my nature. Without a doubt I have an interest in computer science, I have for a long time now.
      Learning to code and understand the machine has been a goal of mine since I learned about its existance. It is sort of a no brainer to push towards a career in a field of CS, web development is one of the fields I have been leaning towards.
        The internet is really fascinating and I strive to understand how it works as much as I can<mark><strong>BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM.</strong></mark>
        I keep losing focus and forgetting how precious my time is. Every second I spend on video games is seconds (or hours) I could be spending shaping my future to meet my needs as best as possible.
        It does not have to be completely all or nothing, I don't have to spend every waking second coding and trying to make projects. Even 20 to 30 minutes is helpful for now.
    
        The power of making new habits and routine is invaluable in this case and <mark><strong>NEEDS TO BE DONE.</strong></mark> 
        One of the main reasons for this journaling page is for me to extract my thoughts at the time negative or positive and save it to read later and get myself back on track. It may not be the prettiest looking
        web page out there, at the moment that does not matter. The purpose it serves to me is the important part I can always make it pop later. The idea is to journal in a code editor and get the ball rolling.
