          <p>It's not my goal to be better than everyone around me and all egotistical.
            I want to help people understand some of the realities that are being manipulated by information distributors to take your time, money, and self-consciousness away. It is important for me to actually practice what I talk and
            complain about almost daily, either with people or with myself in my own mind. I dislike hypocrisy, and in order for me to be the change I want to see, I have to actually<mark><strong>be the change </strong></mark>the world needs. <!--Add a link to extended information--> Daily reminders about who and what I am and the beliefs I hold. To question myself deeply about my thoughts and the things I am saying to other people.
            I am not perfect, in my opinion perfection does not truly exist I will say however that striving to be a better version of yourself and never stopping with some small vision of perfection is helpful. I say this because I beleive that if a person was to reach "Perfection"
            their mission would be complete and progress would sieze to a hault, and since perfect does not really exist progress is continuous. Change is inevitable, it cannot be stopped but it can be slowed down or sped up. This is a powerful quote I read which helped me initiate change into my life.
