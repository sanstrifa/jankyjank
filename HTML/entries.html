          <p>It's not my goal to be better than everyone around me and all egotistical.
            I want to help people understand some of the realities that are being manipulated by information distributors to take your time, money, and self-consciousness away. It is important for me to actually practice what I talk and
            complain about almost daily, either with people or with myself in my own mind. I dislike hypocrisy, and in order for me to be the change I want to see, I have to actually<mark><strong>be the change </strong></mark>the world needs. <!--Add a link to extended information--> Daily reminders about who and what I am and the beliefs I hold. To question myself deeply about my thoughts and the things I am saying to other people.
            I am not perfect, in my opinion perfection does not truly exist I will say however that striving to be a better version of yourself and never stopping with some small vision of perfection is helpful. I say this because I beleive that if a person was to reach "Perfection"
            their mission would be complete and progress would sieze to a hault, and since perfect does not really exist progress is continuous. Change is inevitable, it cannot be stopped but it can be slowed down or sped up. This is a powerful quote I read which helped me initiate change into my life.

    <h1 class="h1title">Entry#2 - 2023-02-27 | <span class="span1">Upgrading Meatsuit</span></h1>
    <div class="col-10">

      <p>Having a project to work on is something I really need for myself. Upgrading my meatsuit is one of them. As silly as it sounds, I view the body as a meatsuit and think of it as a biological 
        machine that I can upgrade through physical exercise. Improving my grip strength and getting stronger with squats have been a priority. 
        Improving the meatsuit does not just mean physical strength either, I am also working on the mind and soul, which feels like a losing battle to be honest. I think one of the things I am lacking is a 
        project that I am really passionate about. Something I can work on over time and see growth, or development. Making a nice front-end website project is one of my ideas but my main idea that I would like to devote 
        a considerable amount more energy into would be a 2D top down video game. The idea is to make something in unity, like a diablo 2 / path of exile hack and slash style looter. It would be a single player game and have a
        story to complete with endgame playablity. I would like to document the progress in an HTML/CSS format to snapshot the development life and progress in web development at the same time.
        These sub-goals or side-quests are imperative and will bind together to form the results in completing the main-quest of upgrading my meatsuit.

    <h1 class="h1title">Entry#3 - 2023-03-19 | <span class="span1">Remain Focused</span></h1>
    <div class="col-10">
<p>
  It can be pretty easy to get carried away with negative thinking. It seems to feed into itself exponentially. The importance of staying focused is imperative. I have a limited amount of
  time to put into obtaining a position in life that would be desirable and more synergistic with my nature. Without a doubt I have an interest in computer science, I have for a long time now.
  Learning to code and understand the machine has been a goal of mine since I learned about its existance. It is sort of a no brainer to push towards a career in a field of CS, web development is one of the fields I have been leaning towards.
    The internet is really fascinating and I strive to understand how it works as much as I can<mark><strong>BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM.</strong></mark>
    I keep losing focus and forgetting how precious my time is. Every second I spend on video games is seconds (or hours) I could be spending shaping my future to meet my needs as best as possible.
    It does not have to be completely all or nothing, I don't have to spend every waking second coding and trying to make projects. Even 20 to 30 minutes is helpful for now.

    The power of making new habits and routine is invaluable in this case and <mark><strong>NEEDS TO BE DONE.</strong></mark> 
    One of the main reasons for this journaling page is for me to extract my thoughts at the time negative or positive and save it to read later and get myself back on track. It may not be the prettiest looking
    web page out there, at the moment that does not matter. The purpose it serves to me is the important part I can always make it pop later. The idea is to journal in a code editor and get the ball rolling.
